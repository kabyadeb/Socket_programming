# Socket_programming
Socket networking can be compared as plugging a cord into an electrical socket !!! 
 
Socket is uniquely identified by using IP adress(like as 'localhost') & port number( It identifies the specific application or service at specific port). 
To communicate with two devices/computers over a network socket is used . 

Here we will see 
1.two way communication through terminals using tcp socket .
2. sending email through socket programming using ssl connection .
